"""Ceiling-derived promotion gates: ask for a share of what is achievable.

A flat gate asks every candidate for the same speedup regardless of how much
speedup the workload can physically give. That is wrong in both directions.

On `ltx-480p`, attention is 15.13% of device time, so the Amdahl ceiling is
1.178x: a flat 1.3x gate is unreachable there by *any* backend, including one
that takes zero time. Candidates get rejected for failing an impossible bar,
and the rejection says nothing about the candidate.

On a workload where attention is 60% of device time the ceiling is 2.5x, and a
flat 1.10x gate would promote something capturing 7% of what was available --
which is a worse outcome dressed as a pass.

So the gate is derived from the ceiling:

    gate = max(1.10, 1 + 0.5 * (ceiling - 1))

Two properties, both deliberate. The floor at 1.10 means a promotion is always
worth the fidelity risk and the maintenance cost of carrying an artifact, even
where the ceiling is low. And the 0.5 coefficient means a candidate must
capture **at least half** of the headroom that exists -- a share of the
achievable, not an absolute that ignores it.

Worked examples:

===============  =======  =====  =====================================
workload         ceiling  gate   note
===============  =======  =====  =====================================
ltx-480p          1.178   1.10   floor binds; half of 17.8% is 8.9%
wan-480p (low)    1.373   1.19   ~half the headroom
wan-480p (high)   1.537   1.27   ~half the headroom
hypothetical      2.500   1.75   a high ceiling demands a high gate
===============  =======  =====  =====================================

The rule never lowers a *quality* gate. Fidelity budgets are independent and
both must pass; this decides only what counts as enough speed.
