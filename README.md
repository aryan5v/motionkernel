MotionKernel profiles real model executions, captures production tensor shapes,
develops and tunes Triton or CUDA C++ kernels, and verifies numerical
correctness, gradients, `torch.compile` compatibility, performance, and
end-to-end integration behavior.

The first target integration is
[FastVideo](https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo), beginning with Wan and
expanding to LTX-Video, Cosmos, and Kandinsky. The optimization platform remains
framework-agnostic: promoted kernels can be consumed by FastVideo, Diffusers,
or other PyTorch video runtimes without requiring the research harness at
inference time.

## Project Status

MotionKernel V1 is proven end to end on FastVideo LTX2. A promoted transformer
artifact passed strict independent correctness and hash verification, executed
6,143 times with zero fallbacks, preserved byte-identical generated frames, and
improved median end-to-end latency from 3.3646s to 3.0991s (1.0857x) across a
15-run A/B on an NVIDIA GB200. An independent 15-run replication measured
1.2514x. See [the V1 evidence report](docs/LTX_V1_R4_ROOT_CAUSE.md) for the
measurements and [docs/SUPPORT_STATUS.md](docs/SUPPORT_STATUS.md) for exactly
what that proof does and does not cover -- it is one artifact, one workload,
one GPU architecture, and one model.

The first video-specific pack covers three Wan boundaries: modulated
pre-attention LayerNorm, post-attention gated residual plus LayerNorm, and the
post-MLP gated residual. All three have been validated across their
production shape corpora on an NVIDIA GB200 (see
[docs/WAN_KERNEL_RESULTS.md](docs/WAN_KERNEL_RESULTS.md)). These are isolated
operator results; complete model packs still require end-to-end benchmark
publication before support is claimed.

The model-independent pipeline includes declarative FastVideo workloads,
resumable profiling, export graph capture, impact ranking, graph-derived spec
generation, autonomous GPU search, strict independent validation, versioned
artifact packaging, generic FastVideo dispatch, full-generation A/B validation,
and fail-closed promotion.

### Naming

The product is **MotionKernel** and the distribution is `motionkernel`. The
import namespace is `autokernel`:

```python
from autokernel.specs import KernelSpec
```

`autokernel` is a **compatibility namespace** inherited from upstream — a name,
not a support level. It is fully supported, it is what type checkers and IDEs
resolve, and it is what every generated `spec.py` imports. It stays because
artifact bundles are hash-verified, so renaming the import would invalidate
artifacts that already exist.

A `motionkernel` import namespace also works at runtime and aliases the same
modules (`motionkernel.specs is autokernel.specs`, with shared class identity).
It is not yet the recommended namespace: because it resolves through a runtime
finder rather than real files, type checkers cannot see it. See
[docs/NAMESPACE_MIGRATION.md](docs/NAMESPACE_MIGRATION.md) for the measured
limitations and the four-phase plan that removes them.

## How It Works

Give MotionKernel a PyTorch model or an external operation specification. It
will:

1. **Profile** the model to find which GPU kernels are bottlenecks
2. **Capture** representative shapes, dtypes, layouts, and environment metadata
3. **Extract** each bottleneck as a standalone Triton or CUDA C++ kernel
4. **Optimize** candidates through an iterative edit, benchmark, and keep/revert loop
5. **Verify** outputs, optional gradients, compilation, and end-to-end behavior
6. **Promote** reproducible kernels into runtime integration packages

The agent reads `program.md` -- the "research org code" -- which contains comprehensive instructions for autonomous operation. It edits `kernel.py` one kernel at a time, runs `bench.py` (fixed benchmark with 5-stage correctness checks + roofline analysis), and either keeps or reverts the change. The orchestrator decides when to move to the next kernel using Amdahl's law.

Experiment wall time depends on the kernel, the shape corpus and the GPU;
`bench.py` records its own elapsed time in every result so a campaign's real
throughput can be read from its run directory rather than estimated.

## FastVideo Technical Preview

Install the release candidate and check the GPU environment:

```bash
uv tool install 'git+https://github.com/aryan5v/motionkernel.git'
motionkernel doctor --require-cuda --fastvideo-checkout /path/to/FastVideo
motionkernel workload list
```

Run the canonical LTX2 campaign:

```bash
LTX_WORKLOAD="$(motionkernel workload path ltx_480p)"

motionkernel optimize \
  --fastvideo-checkout /path/to/FastVideo \
  --model FastVideo/LTX2-Distilled-Diffusers \
  --workload "$LTX_WORKLOAD" \
  --baseline compile \
  --budget-hours 10 \
  --per-candidate-budget-seconds 3600 \
  --output ./runs/ltx2
```

The command exits successfully only with `promoted`,
`no_worthwhile_candidate`, or `preflight_passed`. A promoted artifact has
passed isolated correctness, hash verification, real FastVideo dispatch,
full-generation parity, and the configured end-to-end performance threshold.

Inspect a resulting bundle without importing its executable payload:

```bash
motionkernel artifact verify ./runs/ltx2/artifacts/<artifact-id>
motionkernel artifact inspect ./runs/ltx2/artifacts/<artifact-id>
```

The technical preview is currently validated for single-GPU LTX2 inference on
GB200/sm100 with the packaged 480p workload. Other FastVideo models and GPU
architectures are optimization targets, not yet validated support claims.

## Source Quick Start

**Requirements:** NVIDIA GPU (tested on H100/A100/RTX 4090), Python 3.10+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
# Install uv (if you don't have it)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/aryan5v/motionkernel.git
cd motionkernel
uv sync

# One-time setup: test data + baselines
uv run prepare.py

# Profile a model (ships with GPT-2, LLaMA, BERT -- no transformers needed)
uv run profile.py --model models/llama_7b.py --class-name LlamaModel \
 --input-shape 1,512 --dtype float16

# Extract top bottleneck kernels
uv run extract.py --top 5

# Verify benchmark works
uv run bench.py
```

## Running the Agent

Spin up Claude, Codex, or any coding agent in this directory:

```
Read program.md and let's kick off a new experiment. Start with setup.
```

The agent will:
1. Profile your model and present the optimization plan
2. Create a branch (e.g., `motionkernel/wan-gated-residual`)
3. Optimize each bottleneck kernel in priority order
4. Verify end-to-end correctness and report total speedup

`program.md` is intentionally comprehensive so the agent can run 10+ hours without getting stuck. It includes a 6-tier optimization playbook, decision framework, crash handling, and Amdahl's law reasoning.

## The Pipeline

```
                 profile.py              extract.py           bench.py (loop)         verify.py
Any PyTorch  ──>  Rank kernels  ──>  Generate baseline  ──>  Optimize each  ──>  End-to-end
   model          by GPU time       Triton/CUDA kernels     kernel (agent)       verification
```

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `profile.py` | Profiles any PyTorch model with `torch.profiler`, ranks kernels by GPU time, classifies as compute/memory-bound |
| `extract.py` | Extracts top-N bottleneck kernels into standalone Triton or CUDA C++ kernel files (`--backend triton\|cuda`) |
| `orchestrate.py` | Multi-kernel scheduler: decides which kernel to optimize next using Amdahl's law, tracks aggregate progress |
| `bench.py` | Fixed benchmark: 5-stage correctness (smoke, shape sweep, numerical stability, determinism, edge cases) + performance + roofline |
| `verify.py` | Plugs optimized kernels back into the model, checks end-to-end correctness, reports total speedup |

## Built-in Kernel Specifications

Nine operations inherited from upstream, kept for the standalone single-kernel
workflow. They are starter implementations and reference specifications, not
validated production kernels -- see
[docs/SUPPORT_STATUS.md](docs/SUPPORT_STATUS.md) for what is actually claimed.

| Kernel | Description | Key Metric |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **matmul** | Dense matrix multiplication (M x K) @ (K x N) | TFLOPS |
| **softmax** | Row-parallel numerically stable softmax | GB/s |
| **layernorm** | Layer normalization with affine transform | GB/s |
| **rmsnorm** | RMS normalization (LLaMA-style) | GB/s |
| **flash_attention** | Scaled dot-product attention with causal masking | TFLOPS |
| **fused_mlp** | SwiGLU-style fused MLP (gate + up + down) | TFLOPS |
| **cross_entropy** | Fused cross entropy loss | GB/s |
| **rotary_embedding** | Rotary position embeddings (RoPE) | GB/s |
| **reduce** | Parallel reduction (sum) | GB/s |

Each has a PyTorch reference in `reference.py`, a starter Triton kernel in `kernels/`, and a starter CUDA C++ kernel in `kernels/cuda/`.

Every built-in operation is described by one `KernelSpec` in
`autokernel/specs/builtins.py`. That
specification is the single source of truth for sizes, dtypes, tolerances, edge cases,
FLOP/byte accounting, profiler shape aliases and starter kernels -- `bench.py` and
`extract.py` read it instead of carrying their own per-operation tables.

## Custom Operations

Any operation can be added from outside the repository, without editing `bench.py`,
`extract.py`, `reference.py` or any central map. Write a `KernelSpec` and export it:

```python
# my_ops/gelu_tanh.py
from autokernel.specs import DT_BYTES, EdgeCase, KernelSpec, Tolerance, resolve_torch_dtype, size


def gelu_tanh_ref(x):
    import torch
    return 0.5 * x * (1 + torch.tanh(0.7978845608 * (x + 0.044715 * x ** 3)))


def gen_inputs(size_map, dtype, device, seed=42):
    import torch
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    rows, cols = size_map["rows"], size_map["cols"]
    return {"x": torch.randn(rows, cols, device=device, dtype=resolve_torch_dtype(dtype))}


SPEC = KernelSpec(
    name="gelu_tanh",
    reference_fn=gelu_tanh_ref,
    input_generator=gen_inputs,
    sizes={
        "small": {"rows": 256, "cols": 512},
        "medium": {"rows": 1024, "cols": 1024},
        "large": {"rows": 4096, "cols": 4096},
    },
    dtypes=("float16", "bfloat16", "float32"),
    tolerances={
        "float16": Tolerance(atol=1e-3, rtol=1e-3),
        "bfloat16": Tolerance(atol=2e-3, rtol=2e-3),
        "float32": Tolerance(atol=1e-5, rtol=1e-5),
    },
    flops_fn=8 * size("rows") * size("cols"),
    bytes_fn=2 * size("rows") * size("cols") * DT_BYTES,
    edge_cases=(EdgeCase(name="edge_1023", size={"rows": 1023, "cols": 1023}),),
    shape_keys=("rows", "cols"),
    starter_kernels={"triton": "my_ops/gelu_tanh_kernel.py"},
)
```

Then point the existing commands at it with `--spec LOCATOR`, where a locator is
`path/to/spec.py:ATTRIBUTE` or `package.module:ATTRIBUTE`:

```bash
# benchmark a candidate kernel.py against the external spec
cp examples/custom_ops/add_kernel.py kernel.py
uv run bench.py --spec examples/custom_ops/add.py:SPEC --quick

# generate a starter kernel file for it under workspace/
uv run extract.py --spec examples/custom_ops/add.py:SPEC --top 1
```

Operation selection precedence is `--spec`, then `--kernel`, then `kernel.py::KERNEL_TYPE`,
so existing invocations keep working unchanged. A spec whose name collides with a built-in
is rejected unless `--spec-override` is passed. `ATTRIBUTE` may be a `KernelSpec` or a
zero-argument callable returning one.

Requirements the harness validates before allocating anything on the GPU: an
identifier-like name, `small`/`medium`/`large` sizes, canonical dtype names
(`float16`, `bfloat16`, `float32`), a tolerance for every declared dtype, size keys that
match `shape_keys`, positive integer dimensions in every built-in, edge and default
shape, and starter-kernel files that exist. `starter_kernels={}` is valid for a
benchmark-only specification; extraction skips a backend whose starter is not declared.

A complete, runnable example lives in `examples/custom_ops/add.py` (spec) and
`examples/custom_ops/add_kernel.py` (starter kernel).

Note that loading a spec executes the Python file you point at, exactly like running
`python that_file.py`. Only pass locators you trust.

## Model Optimization Campaigns

FastVideo and other runtimes can export a versioned campaign containing only
operation identities, tensor shape/layout signatures, call counts, aggregate
timings, and environment identity. Validate and rank a campaign without loading
PyTorch or executing any referenced Python:

```bash
uv run campaign.py validate /path/to/campaign.json
uv run campaign.py rank /path/to/campaign.json
uv run campaign.py plan /path/to/campaign.json
```

Once the campaign and its spec locators have been reviewed, prepare all ranked
starter kernels and the existing orchestration state in one step:

```bash
uv run campaign.py prepare /path/to/campaign.json --trust-specs
uv run orchestrate.py plan
```

Preparation writes `workspace/optimization_plan.json`, one candidate kernel per
ranked target, and `workspace/campaign_receipt.json`. The explicit trust flag is
required because a Python spec locator executes code. Continue with
`program.md` for the autonomous experiment loop; every candidate still passes
the fixed correctness gates in `bench.py` before a result can be kept.

For an unattended, resumable run, preparation and the agent loop are one
command:

```bash
uv run campaign.py run /path/to/wan-campaign.json --trust-specs --budget-hours 10
```

Like `prepare`, `run` refuses to load a campaign's Python spec locators
without the explicit `--trust-specs` flag, because loading a spec executes the
Python file it points at. Use `--dry-run` to inspect
`workspace/overnight_prompt.md` without launching an agent, and `--resume`
after an interrupted run. A non-`completed` terminal status is reported as
`CAMPAIGN_RUN: FAIL` with a non-zero exit code. By default the runner invokes
the Codex CLI; `--agent-command` supports trusted alternatives with `{repo}`
and `{prompt_file}` placeholders. The next morning, inspect
`workspace/morning_report.md`, the terminal receipt, agent log, and verified
`kernel_<operation>_<rank>_optimized.py` artifacts in the same directory.

## Workloads and Discovery

The universal optimization path starts from a declarative workload manifest
instead of model-specific scripts. A manifest in `workloads/` describes one
reproducible FastVideo generation benchmark: model identifier, task and
prompt reference, resolution, frame count, inference steps, seed, dtype,
warmup and measured repetitions, and the output-parity policy. Canonical
manifests exist for Wan 2.1 T2V 1.3B 480p and LTX 480p.

```bash
# validate and inspect a manifest
uv run workload.py validate workloads/wan_t2v_1.3b_480p.yaml
uv run workload.py show workloads/wan_t2v_1.3b_480p.yaml

# run a resumable native-versus-optimized A/B through a FastVideo checkout
uv run workload.py run-ab --fastvideo-checkout /path/to/FastVideo \
  --workload workloads/wan_t2v_1.3b_480p.yaml --output workspace/wan_ab

# validate a structured generation result
uv run workload.py validate-result workspace/wan_ab/native_result.json
```

Discovery reports are metadata-only records of where a profiled generation
actually spends time: profiler operator rows, captured FX graph regions with
stable fingerprints, graph breaks, and unsupported operations. They never
contain prompts, weights, activations, tensor values, or model outputs.

```bash
# convert a FastVideo profiler export into a discovery report
uv run discovery.py ingest-profiler workspace/profiler_export.json \
  --output workspace/discovery_report.json

# validate and rank candidate regions by optimistic end-to-end impact
uv run discovery.py validate workspace/discovery_report.json
uv run discovery.py rank workspace/discovery_report.json --impact-floor 0.005
```

Ranking uses measured production frequency and an Amdahl-style ceiling: a
candidate is only worth searching when its optimistic end-to-end improvement
clears the impact floor (0.5% by default). Regions with mutation, collectives,
data-dependent control flow, or unknown aliasing are rejected fail-closed
before they can enter the search pipeline.

## Generalized Verification

The harness compares complete output trees, including nested tensors and metadata. An
external spec may also declare `BackwardSpec` and `CompileSpec` policies. The structured
affine example exercises both:

```bash
cp examples/custom_ops/affine_kernel.py kernel.py

# forward output-tree comparison plus production-shape corpus
uv run bench.py --spec examples/custom_ops/affine.py:SPEC \
  --shape-corpus examples/custom_ops/affine_corpus.json --quick

# optional gradient and full-graph compile gates
uv run bench.py --spec examples/custom_ops/affine.py:SPEC \
  --check-backward --check-compile --quick
```

Compile verification calls `torch.compile` with `fullgraph=True` by default and runs
before performance timing. A dynamic `CompileSpec` exercises two declared shapes through
the same compiled callable. If `torch.compile` is unavailable, the result is
`UNSUPPORTED`, never `PASS`.

Every normal benchmark run atomically writes a schema-versioned JSON record to
`workspace/bench_result.json`; override it with `--result-json PATH`. It includes
forward leaf errors, optional gradient and compile results, shape-corpus identity,
environment metadata and performance results. Stable console verdicts are
`FORWARD_CORRECTNESS`, `BACKWARD_CORRECTNESS` and `COMPILE_CORRECTNESS`.

Use `--baseline eager|compile` to select the timed PyTorch comparison (default:
`eager`). Compile mode uses `torch.compile(..., fullgraph=True)`, performs its
compile/warmup before timing, and records `baseline_mode` in result schema 2.
Correctness always compares with eager PyTorch. If compilation is unavailable or
fails, the benchmark fails instead of silently substituting the eager baseline.

## Resumable overnight optimization

`optimize.py` is the V1 control plane for a model optimization run:

```bash
python optimize.py \
  --fastvideo-checkout /path/to/FastVideo \
  --model Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers \
  --workload workloads/wan_t2v_1.3b_480p.yaml \
  --baseline compile \
  --budget-hours 10 \
  --per-candidate-budget-seconds 3600 \
  --output workspace/wan-overnight
```

The durable pipeline is `baseline → profile → discover → specgen → search →
isolated_validate → package → end_to_end_validate → finalize`. Every stage runs
in an isolated subprocess and exchanges versioned JSON through the run directory.
Re-running the same command resumes completed stages.

### Preflight and the run contract

Before any stage runs or any campaign state is written, a fail-closed preflight
phase validates the whole environment so an unattended run fails in seconds
rather than hours into a GPU allocation. It checks that the FastVideo checkout
exists with the expected package and launcher structure, the workload parses
under the shared schema, the output directory is atomically writable, stage
command names and `{placeholders}` are known and their programs executable, the
resolved search agent exists, and every budget, threshold, and timeout is
finite and positive. It also rejects output filesystems with less than 512 MiB
free and warns below 10 GiB, before a GPU allocation can be wasted.

```bash
python optimize.py ... --preflight-only
```

`--preflight-only` writes `preflight.json` and exits without running a stage or
creating campaign state. `preflight.json` records pass/fail, stable reason
codes, MotionKernel and FastVideo commit identities, the workload SHA-256 and
id, and the execution policy. It never records credentials, environment
secrets, prompts, or raw command arguments: command configurations are stored
as a SHA-256 digest plus the program basename, which is enough to pin and
diagnose a command without persisting anything sensitive.

When a campaign begins, the same material configuration is pinned into a
write-once `run_contract.json`. Every resume compares against it and fails
closed with a stable `contract_mismatch_*` reason code when the model, workload
*content*, FastVideo checkout, baseline, promotion threshold, stage commands,
search-agent command, or candidate timeout has changed. `--budget-hours` is a
per-invocation allowance rather than part of evidence identity, so resuming a
non-terminal campaign may extend its runtime and starts a fresh wall-clock
deadline without rewriting the contract. Hashing the workload means
an edit to the same file path is caught, which a path comparison cannot see.
A checkout is identified by its git commit when one is resolvable, so moving a
checkout is fine while changing its commit is not. Use a new `--output` or
`--no-resume` to start a fresh campaign.

Built-in production adapters run the FastVideo baseline/profile launcher,
MotionKernel discovery/spec generation, autonomous kernel search, independent
isolated validation and packaging, the final FastVideo A/B validation, and
artifact finalization. Search uses the installed Codex CLI by default; pass
`--search-agent-command agent.json` to use another agent argv without a shell.
The JSON array supports `{repo_root}`, `{run_dir}`, `{candidate_dir}`,
`{prompt_file}`, and `{last_message}` placeholders. The fixed validator—not the
search agent—derives benchmark evidence and package inputs. See
[`docs/OPTIMIZE_STAGE_ADAPTERS.md`](docs/OPTIMIZE_STAGE_ADAPTERS.md) for the
contract. The control plane writes `preflight.json`, `run_contract.json`,
`state.json`, per-stage inputs/results/logs, command receipts, `receipt.json`,
and `morning_report.md`. A kernel is promoted only when the final end-to-end run
meets the configured threshold; an isolated benchmark can never promote it.
The built-in adapters still run inside stage subprocesses. They fail closed on
missing FastVideo outputs, malformed metadata, absent benchmark evidence,
failed parity, or dispatch that never selected the candidate.

`--stage-commands` remains available as an expert override for any complete
stage, but it is no longer required for the standard V1 pipeline.

For a CPU-only contract smoke test, set `MOTIONKERNEL_SIMULATE=1` and optionally
`MOTIONKERNEL_SIMULATE_OUTCOME=promoted|no_worthwhile_candidate|fail_at:STAGE`.

## Example Models

Self-contained model definitions inherited by MotionKernel require no
`transformers` library:

| Model | File | Params | Usage |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| GPT-2 Small | `models/gpt2.py` | 124M | `--class-name GPT2 --input-shape 1,1024` |
| LLaMA (compact) | `models/llama_7b.py` | 160M | `--class-name LlamaModel --input-shape 1,512` |
| LLaMA 7B | `models/llama_7b.py` | 7B | `--class-name LlamaModel7B --input-shape 1,2048` |
| BERT-base | `models/bert_base.py` | 110M | `--class-name BertModel --input-shape 8,512` |
| Custom | `models/custom.py` | -- | Template for your own model |

For HuggingFace models (`uv sync --extra models`):

```bash
uv run profile.py --module transformers --class-name AutoModelForCausalLM \
 --pretrained meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf --input-shape 1,2048 --dtype float16
```

## KernelBench Integration

MotionKernel retains integration with [KernelBench](https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench),
the standard benchmark for evaluating AI-generated GPU kernels (250+ problems across 4 difficulty
levels). While most KernelBench evaluations use one-shot LLM generation, MotionKernel runs
**50-300+ iterative refinement experiments per problem** -- systematically exploring the
optimization space instead of guessing.

```bash
# Install KernelBench dependencies
uv sync --extra kernelbench

# Fetch Level 1 problems from HuggingFace
uv run kernelbench/bridge.py fetch --source hf --level 1

# Set up a specific problem for optimization
uv run kernelbench/bridge.py setup --level 1 --problem 1 --source hf

# Evaluate (correctness + speedup vs PyTorch reference)
uv run kernelbench/bench_kb.py

# Batch score an entire level (computes fast_p metric)
uv run kernelbench/scorer.py --level 1
```

The agent reads `kernelbench/program_kb.md` for KernelBench-specific optimization instructions:
how to write `ModelNew` classes, when to use CUDA C++ vs Triton, fusion strategies per problem
level, and the edit-bench-keep/revert loop adapted for the KernelBench `fast_p` metric.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `kernelbench/bridge.py` | Loads problems from HuggingFace or local repo, caches them, generates starter `kernel.py` |
| `kernelbench/bench_kb.py` | Evaluates `ModelNew` vs `Model`: 5-trial correctness + CUDA event timing + stability + determinism |
| `kernelbench/scorer.py` | Batch evaluation across a level, computes `fast_p` at thresholds (1.0x, 1.5x, 2.0x, 3.0x, 5.0x) |
| `kernelbench/program_kb.md` | Agent instructions for KernelBench mode |

## HuggingFace Kernels Export

Export optimized kernels to the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/kernels/en/index)
for easy distribution. Users can then load your kernels with a single line:

```python
from kernels import get_kernel
module = get_kernel("your-username/kernel-name")
```

```bash
# Export an optimized CUDA kernel
uv run export_hf.py --name my_matmul

# Upload to Hub (requires `pip install kernels` and `huggingface-cli login`)
cd workspace/hf_export/my_matmul
kernels upload . --repo_id your-username/my_matmul
```

## Design Choices

**Dual backend: Triton + CUDA C++.** Triton for fast iteration (Python-like syntax, compiles in seconds). CUDA C++ for maximum performance (direct access to tensor cores via `wmma`, PTX intrinsics, shared memory bank-conflict-free layouts). Triton regularly reaches 80-95% of cuBLAS; CUDA C++ can match or exceed it. Both backends share the same `kernel_fn()` interface -- `bench.py` runs identically on either.

**Correctness first.** The benchmark checks kernel output against PyTorch before measuring performance. A fast but wrong kernel is immediately reverted. This prevents the agent from "optimizing" by producing garbage.

**Amdahl's law orchestration.** The orchestrator prioritizes by impact. A 1.5x speedup on a 60% kernel (1.25x end-to-end) beats a 3x speedup on a 5% kernel (1.03x end-to-end). It moves on when diminishing returns set in.

**Single file to modify.** The agent only touches `kernel.py`. Scope stays manageable, diffs reviewable, reverts clean.

**TSV logging.** Results go to a plain `results.tsv` file. Human-readable, git-friendly, trivially parseable, no infrastructure.

## Results Format

Every experiment is logged to `results.tsv` (tab-separated):

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `experiment` | Sequential experiment number (0 = baseline) |
| `tag` | Short identifier |
| `kernel_type` | Which kernel (e.g., `matmul`) |
| `throughput_tflops` | Measured throughput (higher is better) |
| `latency_us` | Execution time in microseconds |
| `pct_peak` | Percentage of GPU theoretical peak |
| `speedup_vs_pytorch` | Speedup vs PyTorch/cuBLAS |
| `correctness` | PASS, FAIL, TIMEOUT, or CRASH |
| `peak_vram_mb` | Peak GPU memory usage |
| `description` | What was tried |

## Credits

MotionKernel builds on AutoKernel's **autoresearch for GPU kernels** approach,
which was directly inspired by Andrej Karpathy's
[autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch). MotionKernel retains
the iterative agent loop while extending the platform toward production video
workloads, explicit operation specifications, representative shape corpora,
and stronger verification.

**KernelBench** integration is based on the work of Simon Guo, Sean Resta, et al. at Stanford's Scaling Intelligence Lab. Their paper ["KernelBench: Can LLMs Write GPU Kernels?"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10517) (2025) established the standard benchmark for evaluating AI-generated GPU kernels. The inherited AutoKernel integration applies iterative optimization instead of one-shot generation. KernelBench dataset and evaluation protocol: [ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench](https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench).

MotionKernel is independently maintained. The original AutoKernel project was
built by [RightNow AI](https://www.rightnowai.co); see
[DOWNSTREAM.md](DOWNSTREAM.md) for the exact fork provenance.

## Changelog

MotionKernel's own release history, and the upstream AutoKernel history it
descends from, are both in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Downstream sections
come first; upstream `v1.x` entries are preserved below them as provenance and
are not MotionKernel releases.
