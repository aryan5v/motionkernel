MotionKernel profiles real model executions, captures production tensor shapes,
develops and tunes Triton or CUDA C++ kernels, and verifies numerical
correctness, gradients, `torch.compile` compatibility, performance, and
end-to-end integration behavior.

The first target integration is
[FastVideo](https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo), beginning with Wan and
expanding to LTX-Video, Cosmos, and Kandinsky. The optimization platform remains
framework-agnostic: promoted kernels can be consumed by FastVideo, Diffusers,
or other PyTorch video runtimes without requiring the research harness at
inference time.

## Project Status

The reusable kernel specification registry, production shape corpora,
structured-output comparison, backward verification, `torch.compile`
verification, and reproducible JSON result artifacts are implemented.

The first video-specific pack covers three Wan boundaries: modulated
pre-attention LayerNorm, post-attention gated residual plus LayerNorm, and the
post-MLP gated residual. All three have been validated across their
production shape corpora on an NVIDIA GB200 (see
[docs/WAN_KERNEL_RESULTS.md](docs/WAN_KERNEL_RESULTS.md)). These are isolated
operator results; complete model packs still require end-to-end benchmark
publication before support is claimed.

A model-independent discovery foundation is also in place: declarative
FastVideo workload manifests, a resumable native-versus-optimized launcher
bridge, metadata-only profiler ingestion, CPU FX graph capture with stable
fingerprints, and impact ranking with an end-to-end floor. Graph-derived
spec generation and generic artifact dispatch are the next stages.

MotionKernel currently retains the `autokernel` Python import namespace for
compatibility with the upstream project. The import namespace will only move
after a documented migration path exists.

## How It Works

Give MotionKernel a PyTorch model or an external operation specification. It
will:

1. **Profile** the model to find which GPU kernels are bottlenecks
2. **Capture** representative shapes, dtypes, layouts, and environment metadata
3. **Extract** each bottleneck as a standalone Triton or CUDA C++ kernel
4. **Optimize** candidates through an iterative edit, benchmark, and keep/revert loop
5. **Verify** outputs, optional gradients, compilation, and end-to-end behavior
6. **Promote** reproducible kernels into runtime integration packages

The agent reads `program.md` -- the "research org code" -- which contains comprehensive instructions for autonomous operation. It edits `kernel.py` one kernel at a time, runs `bench.py` (fixed benchmark with 5-stage correctness checks + roofline analysis), and either keeps or reverts the change. The orchestrator decides when to move to the next kernel using Amdahl's law.

Each experiment takes ~90 seconds. That's ~40 experiments/hour, ~320 overnight, across all kernels.

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** NVIDIA GPU (tested on H100/A100/RTX 4090), Python 3.10+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
# Install uv (if you don't have it)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/aryan5v/motionkernel.git
cd motionkernel
uv sync

# One-time setup: test data + baselines
uv run prepare.py

# Profile a model (ships with GPT-2, LLaMA, BERT -- no transformers needed)
uv run profile.py --model models/llama_7b.py --class-name LlamaModel \
 --input-shape 1,512 --dtype float16

# Extract top bottleneck kernels
uv run extract.py --top 5

# Verify benchmark works
uv run bench.py
```

## Running the Agent

Spin up Claude, Codex, or any coding agent in this directory:

```
Read program.md and let's kick off a new experiment. Start with setup.
```

The agent will:
1. Profile your model and present the optimization plan
2. Create a branch (e.g., `motionkernel/wan-gated-residual`)
3. Optimize each bottleneck kernel in priority order
4. Verify end-to-end correctness and report total speedup

`program.md` is intentionally comprehensive so the agent can run 10+ hours without getting stuck. It includes a 6-tier optimization playbook, decision framework, crash handling, and Amdahl's law reasoning.

## The Pipeline

```
                 profile.py              extract.py           bench.py (loop)         verify.py
Any PyTorch  ──>  Rank kernels  ──>  Generate baseline  ──>  Optimize each  ──>  End-to-end
   model          by GPU time       Triton/CUDA kernels     kernel (agent)       verification
```

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `profile.py` | Profiles any PyTorch model with `torch.profiler`, ranks kernels by GPU time, classifies as compute/memory-bound |
| `extract.py` | Extracts top-N bottleneck kernels into standalone Triton or CUDA C++ kernel files (`--backend triton\|cuda`) |
| `orchestrate.py` | Multi-kernel scheduler: decides which kernel to optimize next using Amdahl's law, tracks aggregate progress |
| `bench.py` | Fixed benchmark: 5-stage correctness (smoke, shape sweep, numerical stability, determinism, edge cases) + performance + roofline |
| `verify.py` | Plugs optimized kernels back into the model, checks end-to-end correctness, reports total speedup |

## Supported Kernels

9 kernel types covering the core operations of modern deep learning:

| Kernel | Description | Key Metric |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **matmul** | Dense matrix multiplication (M x K) @ (K x N) | TFLOPS |
| **softmax** | Row-parallel numerically stable softmax | GB/s |
| **layernorm** | Layer normalization with affine transform | GB/s |
| **rmsnorm** | RMS normalization (LLaMA-style) | GB/s |
| **flash_attention** | Scaled dot-product attention with causal masking | TFLOPS |
| **fused_mlp** | SwiGLU-style fused MLP (gate + up + down) | TFLOPS |
| **cross_entropy** | Fused cross entropy loss | GB/s |
| **rotary_embedding** | Rotary position embeddings (RoPE) | GB/s |
| **reduce** | Parallel reduction (sum) | GB/s |

Each has a PyTorch reference in `reference.py`, a starter Triton kernel in `kernels/`, and a starter CUDA C++ kernel in `kernels/cuda/`.

Every built-in operation is described by one `KernelSpec` in
`autokernel/specs/builtins.py`. That
specification is the single source of truth for sizes, dtypes, tolerances, edge cases,
FLOP/byte accounting, profiler shape aliases and starter kernels -- `bench.py` and
`extract.py` read it instead of carrying their own per-operation tables.

## Custom Operations

Any operation can be added from outside the repository, without editing `bench.py`,
`extract.py`, `reference.py` or any central map. Write a `KernelSpec` and export it:

```python
# my_ops/gelu_tanh.py
from autokernel.specs import DT_BYTES, EdgeCase, KernelSpec, Tolerance, resolve_torch_dtype, size


def gelu_tanh_ref(x):
    import torch
    return 0.5 * x * (1 + torch.tanh(0.7978845608 * (x + 0.044715 * x ** 3)))


def gen_inputs(size_map, dtype, device, seed=42):
    import torch
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    rows, cols = size_map["rows"], size_map["cols"]
    return {"x": torch.randn(rows, cols, device=device, dtype=resolve_torch_dtype(dtype))}


SPEC = KernelSpec(
    name="gelu_tanh",
    reference_fn=gelu_tanh_ref,
    input_generator=gen_inputs,
    sizes={
        "small": {"rows": 256, "cols": 512},
        "medium": {"rows": 1024, "cols": 1024},
        "large": {"rows": 4096, "cols": 4096},
    },
    dtypes=("float16", "bfloat16", "float32"),
    tolerances={
        "float16": Tolerance(atol=1e-3, rtol=1e-3),
        "bfloat16": Tolerance(atol=2e-3, rtol=2e-3),
        "float32": Tolerance(atol=1e-5, rtol=1e-5),
    },
    flops_fn=8 * size("rows") * size("cols"),
    bytes_fn=2 * size("rows") * size("cols") * DT_BYTES,
    edge_cases=(EdgeCase(name="edge_1023", size={"rows": 1023, "cols": 1023}),),
    shape_keys=("rows", "cols"),
    starter_kernels={"triton": "my_ops/gelu_tanh_kernel.py"},
)
```

Then point the existing commands at it with `--spec LOCATOR`, where a locator is
`path/to/spec.py:ATTRIBUTE` or `package.module:ATTRIBUTE`:

```bash
# benchmark a candidate kernel.py against the external spec
cp examples/custom_ops/add_kernel.py kernel.py
uv run bench.py --spec examples/custom_ops/add.py:SPEC --quick

# generate a starter kernel file for it under workspace/
uv run extract.py --spec examples/custom_ops/add.py:SPEC --top 1
```

Operation selection precedence is `--spec`, then `--kernel`, then `kernel.py::KERNEL_TYPE`,
so existing invocations keep working unchanged. A spec whose name collides with a built-in
is rejected unless `--spec-override` is passed. `ATTRIBUTE` may be a `KernelSpec` or a
zero-argument callable returning one.

Requirements the harness validates before allocating anything on the GPU: an
identifier-like name, `small`/`medium`/`large` sizes, canonical dtype names
(`float16`, `bfloat16`, `float32`), a tolerance for every declared dtype, size keys that
match `shape_keys`, positive integer dimensions in every built-in, edge and default
shape, and starter-kernel files that exist. `starter_kernels={}` is valid for a
benchmark-only specification; extraction skips a backend whose starter is not declared.

A complete, runnable example lives in `examples/custom_ops/add.py` (spec) and
`examples/custom_ops/add_kernel.py` (starter kernel).

Note that loading a spec executes the Python file you point at, exactly like running
`python that_file.py`. Only pass locators you trust.

## Model Optimization Campaigns

FastVideo and other runtimes can export a versioned campaign containing only
operation identities, tensor shape/layout signatures, call counts, aggregate
timings, and environment identity. Validate and rank a campaign without loading
PyTorch or executing any referenced Python:

```bash
uv run campaign.py validate /path/to/campaign.json
uv run campaign.py rank /path/to/campaign.json
uv run campaign.py plan /path/to/campaign.json
```

Once the campaign and its spec locators have been reviewed, prepare all ranked
starter kernels and the existing orchestration state in one step:

```bash
uv run campaign.py prepare /path/to/campaign.json --trust-specs
uv run orchestrate.py plan
```

Preparation writes `workspace/optimization_plan.json`, one candidate kernel per
ranked target, and `workspace/campaign_receipt.json`. The explicit trust flag is
required because a Python spec locator executes code. Continue with
`program.md` for the autonomous experiment loop; every candidate still passes
the fixed correctness gates in `bench.py` before a result can be kept.

For an unattended, resumable run, preparation and the agent loop are one
command:

```bash
uv run campaign.py run /path/to/wan-campaign.json --trust-specs --budget-hours 10
```

Like `prepare`, `run` refuses to load a campaign's Python spec locators
without the explicit `--trust-specs` flag, because loading a spec executes the
Python file it points at. Use `--dry-run` to inspect
`workspace/overnight_prompt.md` without launching an agent, and `--resume`
after an interrupted run. A non-`completed` terminal status is reported as
`CAMPAIGN_RUN: FAIL` with a non-zero exit code. By default the runner invokes
the Codex CLI; `--agent-command` supports trusted alternatives with `{repo}`
and `{prompt_file}` placeholders. The next morning, inspect
`workspace/morning_report.md`, the terminal receipt, agent log, and verified
`kernel_<operation>_<rank>_optimized.py` artifacts in the same directory.

## Workloads and Discovery

The universal optimization path starts from a declarative workload manifest
instead of model-specific scripts. A manifest in `workloads/` describes one
reproducible FastVideo generation benchmark: model identifier, task and
prompt reference, resolution, frame count, inference steps, seed, dtype,
warmup and measured repetitions, and the output-parity policy. Canonical
manifests exist for Wan 2.1 T2V 1.3B 480p and LTX 480p.

```bash
# validate and inspect a manifest
uv run workload.py validate workloads/wan_t2v_1.3b_480p.yaml
uv run workload.py show workloads/wan_t2v_1.3b_480p.yaml

# run a resumable native-versus-optimized A/B through a FastVideo checkout
uv run workload.py run-ab --fastvideo-checkout /path/to/FastVideo \
  --workload workloads/wan_t2v_1.3b_480p.yaml --output workspace/wan_ab

# validate a structured generation result
uv run workload.py validate-result workspace/wan_ab/native_result.json
```

Discovery reports are metadata-only records of where a profiled generation
actually spends time: profiler operator rows, captured FX graph regions with
stable fingerprints, graph breaks, and unsupported operations. They never
contain prompts, weights, activations, tensor values, or model outputs.

```bash
# convert a FastVideo profiler export into a discovery report
uv run discovery.py ingest-profiler workspace/profiler_export.json \
  --output workspace/discovery_report.json

# validate and rank candidate regions by optimistic end-to-end impact
uv run discovery.py validate workspace/discovery_report.json
uv run discovery.py rank workspace/discovery_report.json --impact-floor 0.005
```

Ranking uses measured production frequency and an Amdahl-style ceiling: a
candidate is only worth searching when its optimistic end-to-end improvement
clears the impact floor (0.5% by default). Regions with mutation, collectives,
data-dependent control flow, or unknown aliasing are rejected fail-closed
before they can enter the search pipeline.

## Generalized Verification

The harness compares complete output trees, including nested tensors and metadata. An
external spec may also declare `BackwardSpec` and `CompileSpec` policies. The structured
affine example exercises both:

```bash
cp examples/custom_ops/affine_kernel.py kernel.py

# forward output-tree comparison plus production-shape corpus
uv run bench.py --spec examples/custom_ops/affine.py:SPEC \
  --shape-corpus examples/custom_ops/affine_corpus.json --quick

# optional gradient and full-graph compile gates
uv run bench.py --spec examples/custom_ops/affine.py:SPEC \
  --check-backward --check-compile --quick
```

Compile verification calls `torch.compile` with `fullgraph=True` by default and runs
before performance timing. A dynamic `CompileSpec` exercises two declared shapes through
the same compiled callable. If `torch.compile` is unavailable, the result is
`UNSUPPORTED`, never `PASS`.

Every normal benchmark run atomically writes a schema-versioned JSON record to
`workspace/bench_result.json`; override it with `--result-json PATH`. It includes
forward leaf errors, optional gradient and compile results, shape-corpus identity,
environment metadata and performance results. Stable console verdicts are
`FORWARD_CORRECTNESS`, `BACKWARD_CORRECTNESS` and `COMPILE_CORRECTNESS`.

## Example Models

Self-contained model definitions inherited by MotionKernel require no
`transformers` library:

| Model | File | Params | Usage |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| GPT-2 Small | `models/gpt2.py` | 124M | `--class-name GPT2 --input-shape 1,1024` |
| LLaMA (compact) | `models/llama_7b.py` | 160M | `--class-name LlamaModel --input-shape 1,512` |
| LLaMA 7B | `models/llama_7b.py` | 7B | `--class-name LlamaModel7B --input-shape 1,2048` |
| BERT-base | `models/bert_base.py` | 110M | `--class-name BertModel --input-shape 8,512` |
| Custom | `models/custom.py` | -- | Template for your own model |

For HuggingFace models (`uv sync --extra models`):

```bash
uv run profile.py --module transformers --class-name AutoModelForCausalLM \
 --pretrained meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf --input-shape 1,2048 --dtype float16
```

## KernelBench Integration

MotionKernel retains integration with [KernelBench](https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench),
the standard benchmark for evaluating AI-generated GPU kernels (250+ problems across 4 difficulty
levels). While most KernelBench evaluations use one-shot LLM generation, MotionKernel runs
**50-300+ iterative refinement experiments per problem** -- systematically exploring the
optimization space instead of guessing.

```bash
# Install KernelBench dependencies
uv sync --extra kernelbench

# Fetch Level 1 problems from HuggingFace
uv run kernelbench/bridge.py fetch --source hf --level 1

# Set up a specific problem for optimization
uv run kernelbench/bridge.py setup --level 1 --problem 1 --source hf

# Evaluate (correctness + speedup vs PyTorch reference)
uv run kernelbench/bench_kb.py

# Batch score an entire level (computes fast_p metric)
uv run kernelbench/scorer.py --level 1
```

The agent reads `kernelbench/program_kb.md` for KernelBench-specific optimization instructions:
how to write `ModelNew` classes, when to use CUDA C++ vs Triton, fusion strategies per problem
level, and the edit-bench-keep/revert loop adapted for the KernelBench `fast_p` metric.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `kernelbench/bridge.py` | Loads problems from HuggingFace or local repo, caches them, generates starter `kernel.py` |
| `kernelbench/bench_kb.py` | Evaluates `ModelNew` vs `Model`: 5-trial correctness + CUDA event timing + stability + determinism |
| `kernelbench/scorer.py` | Batch evaluation across a level, computes `fast_p` at thresholds (1.0x, 1.5x, 2.0x, 3.0x, 5.0x) |
| `kernelbench/program_kb.md` | Agent instructions for KernelBench mode |

## HuggingFace Kernels Export

Export optimized kernels to the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/kernels/en/index)
for easy distribution. Users can then load your kernels with a single line:

```python
from kernels import get_kernel
module = get_kernel("your-username/kernel-name")
```

```bash
# Export an optimized CUDA kernel
uv run export_hf.py --name my_matmul

# Upload to Hub (requires `pip install kernels` and `huggingface-cli login`)
cd workspace/hf_export/my_matmul
kernels upload . --repo_id your-username/my_matmul
```

## Design Choices

**Dual backend: Triton + CUDA C++.** Triton for fast iteration (Python-like syntax, compiles in seconds). CUDA C++ for maximum performance (direct access to tensor cores via `wmma`, PTX intrinsics, shared memory bank-conflict-free layouts). Triton regularly reaches 80-95% of cuBLAS; CUDA C++ can match or exceed it. Both backends share the same `kernel_fn()` interface -- `bench.py` runs identically on either.

**Correctness first.** The benchmark checks kernel output against PyTorch before measuring performance. A fast but wrong kernel is immediately reverted. This prevents the agent from "optimizing" by producing garbage.

**Amdahl's law orchestration.** The orchestrator prioritizes by impact. A 1.5x speedup on a 60% kernel (1.25x end-to-end) beats a 3x speedup on a 5% kernel (1.03x end-to-end). It moves on when diminishing returns set in.

**Single file to modify.** The agent only touches `kernel.py`. Scope stays manageable, diffs reviewable, reverts clean.

**TSV logging.** Results go to a plain `results.tsv` file. Human-readable, git-friendly, trivially parseable, no infrastructure.

## Results Format

Every experiment is logged to `results.tsv` (tab-separated):

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `experiment` | Sequential experiment number (0 = baseline) |
| `tag` | Short identifier |
| `kernel_type` | Which kernel (e.g., `matmul`) |
| `throughput_tflops` | Measured throughput (higher is better) |

| `pct_peak` | Percentage of GPU theoretical peak |
| `speedup_vs_pytorch` | Speedup vs PyTorch/cuBLAS |
| `correctness` | PASS, FAIL, TIMEOUT, or CRASH |
| `peak_vram_mb` | Peak GPU memory usage |
| `description` | What was tried |

## Credits

MotionKernel builds on AutoKernel's **autoresearch for GPU kernels** approach,
which was directly inspired by Andrej Karpathy's
[autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch). MotionKernel retains
the iterative agent loop while extending the platform toward production video
workloads, explicit operation specifications, representative shape corpora,
and stronger verification.

**KernelBench** integration is based on the work of Simon Guo, Sean Resta, et al. at Stanford's Scaling Intelligence Lab. Their paper ["KernelBench: Can LLMs Write GPU Kernels?"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10517) (2025) established the standard benchmark for evaluating AI-generated GPU kernels. The inherited AutoKernel integration applies iterative optimization instead of one-shot generation. KernelBench dataset and evaluation protocol: [ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench](https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench).

MotionKernel is independently maintained. The original AutoKernel project was
built by [RightNow AI](https://www.rightnowai.co); see
[DOWNSTREAM.md](DOWNSTREAM.md) for the exact fork provenance.
